    <h4 id="benefits">Benefits of server-side components</h4>
    <p>By definition, component-based development is an approach to
      software development that focuses on the design and development of
      reusable components. The essence of isolated component development is
      exactly the same as the logic of industrial production based on
      standardized raw materials and components. Component developers
      create components that perform general or specific sub-tasks, from
      which any application can then be assembled. The components can
      operate in an isolated, sandboxed environment and are often
      independent of the business logic of the final use. The given
      component must be able to receive specific parameters, have an
      expected mode of operation, and its output events are also defined.
    </p>
    <p>All components made in this way are fully tested, documented in a
      standard way, and can be easily reused in any application. Developer
      resource management is also an important aspect, because these
      components can be made in parallel as desired, independently of the
      specific applications.
    </p>
    <p>The approach first became dominant in client-side application
      development for technical reasons. However, the advantages of the
      solution can also be used in server-side programming, and the
      possibilities of server-side technology offer even additional
      advantages.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">
        The development of a client-side
        application and component takes place in a very complex ecosystem.
        An average node_modules size can be hundreds of MB and contain
        hundreds or even over a thousand different packages. Each of these
        also means external dependencies of varying quality and reliability,
        which is also a big security risk. In addition, the constant
        updating and tracking of these different packages and the dozens of
        frameworks and technologies based on them requires a lot of
        resources.&nbsp;<br/>
        Server-side components have little or <strong><em>no
        external dependencies</em></strong>. The components can be easily
        created within the technical capabilities of a specific server-side
        language. Their maintenance needs are limited to their actual code,
        which is very small and much safer due to the lack of large external
        dependencies.
      </p></li>
      <li><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">
        The language of client-side
        components is basically Javascript, but most server-side languages
        are much more efficient and safer programming languages. JavaScript
        is originally an add-on to html code and browsers, which was
        originally created to increase the efficiency of the user interface
        and not to develop the codebase of complex programs.&nbsp;<br/>
        During development, it is possible to partially replace it with, for
        example, the Typescript language, but this also means additional
        dependencies and an increase in the complexity of the development
        ecosystem, the end result of which will still be a Javascript
        codebase. This practically means that a code written in a
        programming language is translated into the code of another
        language, and the content to be displayed is created during its
        execution. In the process, there are many intermediate steps, used
        resources, error possibilities, security risks and
        uncertainties.<br/>
        With the server-side components, it is possible
        to simply <strong><em>write the program code in an easy-to-use and
        safe language</em></strong>, the end result of which is the html
        content to be displayed.
      </p></li>
      <li><p>
        Client-side components usually communicate with the server
        using a JSON-based REST API and receive the data to be displayed.
        This also means that the data retrieval must adapt to the data
        structure of the REST API. In other words, the database data must
        first be converted to this structure, and then reprocessed on the
        client side for final display. In addition to possible changes to
        the data structure, this also means JSON encoding and decoding in
        all cases.&nbsp;<br/>
        The server-side components <strong><em>can
        directly access the database</em></strong> and use the data
        immediately in the data structure to be displayed. This also means
        <strong><em>faster rendering and better resource management</em></strong><em>
        </em>for the server-side components.
      </p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Reducing the complexity and dependencies of program development
      means a shorter development time and the creation of products of
      better quality and lower cost.</p>

    <h4 id="request_management">HTTP request management</h4>
    <p>Traditional server-side applications send complete HTML pages to
      browsers for display. Each response from the server replaces the
      entire screen. However, the components are organized based on a
      different logic. These are hierarchically organized, logically
      independent html code parts. Components are able to independently
      react and process user interactions and notify other processing
      components of the processing results. The entire page is not replaced
      or reloaded in the browser, only the required parts of the
      application.
    </p>
    <p>This is not a problem for client-side components, because the
      component state data is stored locally and the components are
      regenerated within the browser. Unfortunately, this principle of
      operation cannot be implemented with HTTP standard requests at the
      moment.
    </p>
    <p>Fortunately, there is a great program library that implements
      exactly the functionality required for component communication. 
      <a href="https://htmx.org/" target="_blank">Htmx</a>
      is small (~14k), dependency-free, browser-oriented javascript library
      that allows you to access modern browser features directly from HTML,
      rather than using javascript. Yes, in a funny way, we can currently
      get to the Javascript-free world with the help of a Javascript
      library.&nbsp;:-)
    </p>
    <p>The server-side components use only a small part of the
      possibilities of <a href="https://v1.htmx.org/" target="_blank">htmx</a>.
      With the help of the function library, we are able to send POST
      requests with any html element, and replace the HTML code fragment
      returned as a response anywhere on the page without reloading the
      page.
    </p>
    
    <h4 id="events">Server-side component events</h4>
    <p>The components of <a href="https://github.com/nervatura/component" target="_blank">the
      source code</a> for the description are implemented in Go, but the
      same logic can be implemented in any other server-side programming
      language. These components are not frameworks, they only use Go’s
      built-in packages and have no external dependencies. A library of
      components whose elements can be freely combined with each other and
      easily developed further. It’s actually just <strong><em>a code
      implementation proposal that anyone can easily use to create a
      server-side component in any programming language</em></strong>.
    </p>
    <img class="pic" src="event.svg" name="Event" width="643" height="278" border="0"/>
    <ul>
      <li><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">
        A component element of the HTML
        code sends a POST request with optional URL-encoded form data to the
        server
      </p></li>
      <li><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">
        The server creates a <strong>TriggerEvent</strong>
        object by processing the header and form data of the request. The
        TriggerEvent contains the id and name attributes of the sending HTML
        element, the identifier of the response’s target element, and the
        form data.
      </p></li>
      <li><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">
        The server creates the main
        component of the Application component and loads the state data from
        memory or file or database storage based on the session ID of the
        request. Passes the TriggerEvent object to the OnRequest function of
        the main component for processing.
      </p></li>
      <li><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">
        Based on their identifiers, the
        main component can access all the elements of the component’s
        hierarchy, not just its direct child components. The main component
        passes the TriggerEvent object to the OnRequest function of its
        child component.
      </p></li>
      <li><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">
        The trigger component processes
        the data received in the TriggerEvent and modifies its own state if
        necessary. Creates a <strong>ResponseEvent</strong> object that
        contains itself, the name of the component and the event, and any
        event response data. If the component has an OnResponse function, it
        passes the ResponseEvent object to the parent component for further
        processing, otherwise it returns it as a response to the main
        component.
      </p></li>
      <li><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">
        Based on the name of the event,
        the parent component processes the data of the ResponseEvent object
        and modifies its own state, if necessary. Creates a new
        ResponseEvent object that contains itself, the name of the
        component, and the new name of the event, along with the new data
        for the response to the event. If the parent component has an
        OnResponse function, it passes the ResponseEvent object to its own
        parent component for further processing, otherwise it returns it as
        a response to the main component.
      </p></li>
      <li><p>
        The main component creates the component HTML code of the
        last ResponseEvent object returned with the changed states. The
        returned component can be the original destination component or the
        HTML code of any parent component up to and including the main
        component. But the result of the processing can be the HTML code of
        any other component in the application, such as a Toast component
        that displays an error message. It may also contain other
        instructions to the browser, such as redirecting the client page
        with or without reloading the page.
      </p></li>
    </ul>
    <h4 id="creating">Creating a server-side component</h4>
    <p>The basis of the components is a data-driven template, which
      contains the rules of their appearance and behavior. The components
      use the <strong><em>declarative template</em></strong> from the
      <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/text/template" target="_blank">text/template
      package</a> in the go standard library. In traditional server-side
      programming, the same package is the basis for generating the html
      code displayed on the client side.
    </p>
    <p>The main difference is that templates do not contain the rules of
      entire pages or certain parts of them, but the generated independent
      small html code fragments are organized based on a different logic.
      These hierarchically organized, logically independent html code parts
      are able to independently react and process user interactions and
      notify other components of the processing results. React’s JSX or
      Lit’s declarative template works on the same principle, but the
      same logic can be implemented in any other server-side programming
      language’s template package with similar functionality.
    </p>
    <p>All components have their own properties that determine their
      current state and based on which the component’s Render function
      generates the HTML code. Each component has a Render function and a
      few other similar mandatory functions that can be used to safely
      query and set all properties of the component.
    </p>
    <p>The <strong>ClientComponent</strong> interface contains the
      mandatory functions that are available in all components, and each
      component is also of the ClientComponent type in addition to its own
      type. The <strong>BaseComponent</strong> type is likewise a
      ClientComponent, which, in addition to the mandatory functions of the
      interface, also contains properties and functions that all components
      based on it inherit and can use if necessary.
    </p>
    <img class="pic" src="comp.svg" name="Components" width="643" height="267" border="0"/>
    <p>The easiest way to <strong><em>create a new component is to add new properties 
      and functions to the</em></strong> <strong>BaseComponent</strong> <strong> <em> and 
      override the functions of the</em></strong> <strong>ClientComponent</strong><strong> <em>
      interface</em></strong> if necessary. The <strong>Application</strong> component 
      is a top-level element to which all other components belong. This element is completely 
      never replaced, only some of its parts can change. Its task is to load and manage all 
      static elements required for the operation and display of the components, such as style 
      sheets and the <a href="https://htmx.org/" target="_blank">htmx</a> package.
    </p>

    <h4 id="examples">Examples and demo application</h4>
    <p>The logic of the components can be understood most easily from the code 
      of the existing components. The source code repository contains sample code 
      for ~15 server-side components, from the basic input component to the complex 
      component.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">
        The <strong>NumberInput</strong>
        component, for example, is a simple elemental component that
        directly receives events from the client interface via OnRequest. It
        validates and stores the new value received in TriggerEvent, then
        returns it directly in the ResponseEvent event or transmits its new
        state to the parent component via the OnResponse function.
      </p></li>
      <li><p>
        <strong>Login</strong> and <strong>Locale</strong> are
        complex components that do not receive their own OnRequest event,
        but receive the processed events of the client interface through
        their child components. In addition to the mandatory functions of
        ClientComponent, they also have their own functions (for example,
        getComponent, response, msg) with which they initialize their own
        child components and handle the ResponseEvent events of the
        components.
      </p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>The css files of the components are included in the static
      package. The index.css contains the reference to the style sheets of
      all components, so it is sufficient to specify this in the
      Application HeadLink property. The styles of the new components can
      be specified in additional css files and the styles of the existing
      components can also be overwritten.
    </p>
    <p>The <strong>demo application</strong> displays all components with
      their test data. Applications can store component state in memory,
      but they can save it anywhere in json format and load it back. The
      demo application can store session data in memory and as session
      files. The source code of the example application also contains an
      example of using a session database (sqlite3, postgres, mysql,
      mssql). If you want to use a database session, uncomment before
      importing the database driver you want to use.
